# Keeper App built with React

* Developed a clone of Google keep using Hooks and States in React.js
* Added the feature to dynamically Add and Delete Notes by passing parameters.
* This is a simple clone/imitation of Google Keep made with React from Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. It uses React Hooks, state, props, and array mapping to allow for the creation and deletion of notes.
* Keeper uses Material-UI components and icons, and this background image from transparenttextures.com.
